# Wraps the inline `for p in tests/probes/probe-*.{js,sh}; do ...` loop
# documented in tests/probes/README.md:49-57 with exit-code aggregation
# AND a per-probe `timeout 30` wrapper (D-16; POSIX coreutils `timeout`).
# Stuck probes no longer block the pre-commit gate — exit code 124 = TIMED OUT.

# Run directly:

# Exit code 0 = all probes passed. Nonzero = at least one probe failed
